# Langchain Document Loader

This repository demonstrates the use of various document loaders in LangChain to ingest and process data from multiple sources and formats. It serves as a practical guide for understanding how to utilize LangChain's document loading capabilities effectively.

## ðŸ“„ Overview

LangChain provides a suite of document loaders that facilitate the ingestion of data from diverse sources, converting them into a standardized `Document` format comprising `page_content` and `metadata`.

This repository includes implementations for loading documents from text files, PDFs, CSVs, directories, and web pages.

For a detailed explanation of these loaders, refer to the [Notes Document Loaders in LangChain.pdf](Notes%20Document%20Loaders%20in%20LangChain.pdf) included in this repository.
